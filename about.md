Hi, my name is ***Deepak Shivanandappa***, and I’m a Software Developer interested in design, development, and writing. I have 10+ years of experience building large-scale enterprise web applications and cloud/saas-based applications.

>This is my personal technical blog. My goal of running this blog is to document the things I learn on a day-to-day basis and share a thing or two with the world.

If you have any questions, comments, or would just like to say hello, please don’t hesitate to  <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}?subject={{ site.title }}%20Blog%20-%20Enquiry" class="social-links__entry" target="_blank"> drop me a line.</a> I’ll be sure to respond promptly!
